<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This App is readily available on [Listy.dev](https://listy.dev)

If you are interested in hosting your own version of this app, you will need to create an account with [Spotify For Developers](https://developer.spotify.com/) in order to access the necessary APIs that this app utilizes.


1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Fill in Client Secret Environment Variable with what you receive from your Spotify For Developers Account. This will provide you access to Spotify Web APIs

4. Replace the Redirect URI with your personal URL of choice to host the server



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Basic Documentation

There are 3 Sections of this Web App:
<ul><li>Top Tracks</li> <li>Top Artists</li> <li>Recently Played </li> </ul>

<p>For the Top Tracks and Top Artists section, you have the option to select a timeframe of 
<ul><li>All Time</li> <li>Most Recent 6 Months</li> <li>Most Recent Month</li> </ul></p>

<p>When you select your section and timeframe of interest, you will receive a list of your top songs/artists. For the Top Tracks section, you will receive your top 50 tracks of the selected timeframe. For the Top Artists section, you will receive a list of your top 50 artists. For the Recently Played section, you will receive your 50 most recent tracks that you have played.</p>

<p>Each of the items on the list you generate will link you to their respective Spotify page.</p>

<p> You can also create a playlist from your list of songs/artists which will create a playlist directly in your Spotify Account. No extra work required! Just name your playlist and it will show up on your Spotify App.</p>
